And given that our brains are plastic, and all develop differently based on our life experiences, why even expect that a few rules might be helpful to us all? People don t clamour for rules, even in the Bible as when Moses comes down the mountain, after a long absence, bearing the tablets inscribed with ten commandments, and finds the Children of Israel in revelry. They d been Pharaoh s slaves and subject to his tyrannical regulations for four hundred years, and after that Moses subjected them to the harsh desert wilderness for another forty years, to purify them of their slavishness. Now, free at last, they are unbridled, and have lost all control as they dance wildly around an idol, a golden calf, displaying all manner of corporeal corruption.",

But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we quickly become slaves to our passions and there s nothing freeing about that.

The old Hebrew story makes it clear how the ancients felt about our prospects for civilized behaviour in the absence of rules that seek to elevate our gaze and raise our standards. One neat thing about the Bible story is that it doesn t simply list its rules, as lawyers or legislators or administrators might; it embeds them in a dramatic tale that illustrates why we need them, thereby making them easier to understand. Similarly, in this book Professor Peterson doesn t just propose his twelve rules, he tells stories, too, bringing to bear his knowledge of many fields as he illustrates and explains why the best rules do not ultimately restrict us but instead facilitate our goals and make for fuller, freer lives.",

Here, the rule was Speak your mind. If the conversation turned to politics, people of different political persuasions spoke to each other indeed, looked forward to it in a manner that is increasingly rare. Sometimes Wodek s own opinions, or truths, exploded out of him, as did his laugh. Then he d hug whoever had made him laugh or provoked him to speak his mind with greater intensity than even he might have intended.

Wodek is a silver-haired, lion-maned hunter, always on the lookout for potential public intellectuals, who knows how to spot people who can really talk in front of a TV camera and who look authentic because they are (the camera picks up on that).

And chances are, if you or someone you love is not suffering now, they will be within five years, unless you are freakishly lucky. Rearing kids is hard, work is hard, aging, sickness and death are hard, and Jordan emphasized that doing all that totally on your own, without the benefit of a loving relationship, or wisdom, or the psychological insights of the greatest psychologists, only makes it harder. He wasn t scaring the students; in fact, they found this frank talk reassuring, because in the depths of their psyches, most of them knew what he said was true, even if there was never a forum to discuss it perhaps because the adults in their lives had become so naively overprotective that they deluded themselves into thinking that not talking about suffering would in some way magically protect their children from it.",

Where Freud made great contributions in explaining neuroses by, among other things, focusing on understanding what we might call a failed-hero story (that of Oedipus), Jordan focused on triumphant heroes. In all these triumph stories, the hero has to go into the unknown, into an unexplored territory, and deal with a new great challenge and take great risks.

Then we could first agree on the facts, and, maybe, one day, develop a scientific code of ethics (which has yet to arrive). Moreover, by implying that values had a lesser reality than facts, science contributed in yet another way to moral relativism, for it treated value as secondary.

Because of this, scientists have been able to map the neural circuitry of lobsters very accurately. This has helped us understand the structure and function of the brain and behaviour of more complex animals, including human beings. Lobsters have more in common with you than you might think (particularly when you are feeling crabby ha ha). Lobsters live on the ocean floor.

He also wants to convince competitors for that space to keep their distance. Birds and Territory My dad and I designed a house for a wren family when I was ten years old.

This made it a good house for wrens, who are tiny, and not so good for other, larger birds, who couldn t get in.

Chickens, like suburbanites, live communally. Songbirds, such as wrens, do not, but they still inhabit a dominance hierarchy. It s just spread out over more territory. The wiliest, strongest, healthiest and most fortunate birds occupy prime territory, and defend it. Because of this, they are more likely to attract high-quality mates, and to hatch chicks who survive and thrive.

The chemical information exchanged in the spray can have the same effect, convincing a less healthy or less aggressive lobster to retreat.

But standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only physical, because you re not only a body. You re a spirit, so to speak a psyche as well. Standing up physically also implies and invokes and demands standing up metaphysically. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being. Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe.

In my own periods of darkness, in the underworld of the soul, I find myself frequently overcome and amazed by the ability of people to befriend each other, to love their intimate partners and parents and children, and to do what they must do to keep the machinery of the world running. I knew a man, injured and disabled by a car accident, who was employed by a local utility. For years after the crash he worked side by side with another man, who for his part suffered with a degenerative neurological disease. They cooperated while repairing the lines, each making up for the other s inadequacy. This sort of everyday heroism is the rule, I believe, rather than the exception. Most individuals are dealing with one or more serious health problems while going productively and uncomplainingly about their business.",

Yet people prevail and continue to do difficult and effortful tasks to hold themselves and their families and society together. To me this is miraculous so much so that a dumbfounded gratitude is the only appropriate response.

(Not too many years later she would plant strawberries in Norway and run safaris through Africa and smuggle trucks across the Tuareg-menaced Sahara Desert, and babysit orphan gorillas in the Congo.) We had a nice place in a new high-rise, overlooking the broad valley of the North Saskatchewan River. We had a view of the city skyline in the background. I bought a beautiful new Yamaha upright piano, in a fit of enthusiasm. The place looked good. I heard through the grapevine that Ed Chris s younger cousin had moved to the city.

Someone could be homecoming queen. Someone else could be spelling-bee champ, math whiz or basketball star. There were only one or two mechanics and a couple of teachers. In each of their domains, these local heroes had the opportunity to enjoy the serotonin-fuelled confidence of the victor. It may be for that reason that people who were born in small towns are statistically overrepresented among the eminent. 68 If you re one in a million now, but originated in modern New York, there s twenty of you and most of us now live in cities.

A child who is crying angrily, demanding attention, is not making himself popular.

Deprivation of liberty causes pain in a manner essentially similar to that of physical trauma. The same can be said of the use of social isolation (including time out).

Everyone says, We don t understand. How can we still pretend that? Tolstoy understood, more than a century ago. The ancient authors of the biblical story of Cain and Abel understood, as well, more than twenty centuries ago. They described murder as the first act of post- Edenic history: and not just murder, but fratricidal murder murder not only of someone innocent but of someone ideal and good, and murder done consciously to spite the creator of the universe.

What has emerged from behind its corpse, however and this is an issue of central importance is something even more dead; something that was never alive, even in the past: nihilism, as well as an equally dangerous susceptibility to new, totalizing, utopian ideas .

It can merely act out its nature, concretely, in the here-and-now. If it cannot manifest in its behavior what the environment demands while doing so, it will simply die. But that is not true of human beings. We can produce abstracted representations of potential modes of Being. We can produce an idea in the theatre of the imagination. We can test it out against our other ideas, the ideas of others, or the world itself. If it falls short, we can let it go. We can, in Popper s formulation, let our ideas die in our stead. 147 Then the essential part, the creator of those ideas, can continue onward, now untrammeled, by comparison, with error.

It is for this reason that the depth psychologists Freud and Jung paramount among them insisted that the human psyche was a battleground for ideas. An idea has an aim. It wants something. It posits a value structure. An idea believes that what it is aiming for is better than what it has now.

So, I began paying much closer attention to what I was doing and saying. The experience was disconcerting, to say the least. I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged. I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue. I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted. I was using language to bend and twist the world into delivering what I thought was necessary. But I was a fake.

This is partly because of technical insufficiency: the systems simply don t work. But it is also in no small part because of the lack of trust characteristic of systemically corrupt societies.

But no one says anything, as the shared society and negotiated order of the household reveals itself as inadequate, or disintegrates, in the face of the unexpected and threatening. Everybody whistles in the dark, instead. Communication would require admission of terrible emotions: resentment, terror, loneliness, despair, jealousy, frustration, hatred, boredom. Moment by moment, it s easier to keep the peace. But in the background, in Billy Bixbee s house, and in all that are like it, the dragon grows. One day it bursts forth, in a form that no one can ignore. It lifts the very household from its foundations. Then it s an affair, or a decades-long custody dispute of ruinous economic and psychological proportions.",

Sometimes I stood there and watched them. There are rough, wide, shallow concrete steps there, leading up from the street to the front entrance, accompanied by tubular iron handrails, about two and a half inches in diameter and twenty feet long. The crazy kids, almost always boys, would pull back about fifteen yards from the top of the steps. Then they would place a foot on their boards, and skate like mad to get up some speed. Just before they collided with the handrail, they would reach down, grab their board with a single hand and jump onto the top of the rail, boardsliding their way down its length, propelling themselves off and landing sometimes, gracefully, still atop their boards, sometimes, painfully, off them.

His coat was black, as were his pants and boots. He was very tall, and thin, and somewhat stooped. Chris, I joked. You look like a serial killer. Ha bloody ha. The three came back from their walk. Chris was out of sorts. There were strangers in his territory. Another happy couple. It was salt in his wounds. We had dinner, pleasantly enough. We talked, and ended the evening. But I couldn t sleep. Something wasn t right. It was in the air. At four in the morning, I had had enough. I crawled out of bed. I knocked quietly on Chris s door and went without waiting for an answer into his room. He was awake on the bed, staring at the ceiling, as I knew he would be. I sat down beside him. I knew him very well. I talked him down from his murderous rage. Then I went back to bed, and slept. The next morning my brother pulled me aside.",

Maybe I picked up some change in scent that night, when death hung in the air. Chris had a very bitter odour. He showered frequently, but the towels and the sheets picked up the smell. It was impossible to get them clean. It was the product of a psyche and a body that did not operate harmoniously.

We might instead note with gratitude that a complex, sophisticated culture allows for many games and many successful players, and that a well-structured culture allows the individuals that compose it to play and to win, in many different fashions. It is also perverse to consider culture the creation of men. Culture is symbolically, archetypally, mythically male. That s partly why the idea of the patriarchy is so easily swallowed. But it is certainly the creation of humankind, not the creation of men (let alone white men, who nonetheless contributed their fair share).

When that prince escapes, and presses the Evil Queen too hard, she turns into the Dragon of Chaos itself.

People are antisocial because they don t like the members of other groups. Exactly why this is so has been the subject of continual debate. I think it might be a solution to a complex problem of optimization. Such problems arise, for example, when two or more factors are important, but none cannot be maximized without diminishing the others. A problem of this sort emerges, for example, because of the antipathy between cooperation and competition, both of which are socially and psychologically desirable. Cooperation is for safety, security and companionship. Competition is for personal growth and status. However, if a given group is too small, it has no power or prestige, and cannot fend off other groups. In consequence, being one of its members is not that useful.",

Perhaps people identify with groups at the flip of a coin because they deeply want to organize themselves, protect themselves, and still have some reasonable probability of climbing the dominance hierarchy. Then they favour their own group, because favouring it helps it thrive and climbing something that is failing is not a useful strategy.

Thinking leads inexorably to the abyss. It did not work for Tolstoy. It might not even have worked for Nietzsche, who arguably thought more clearly about such things than anyone in history. But if it is not thinking that can be relied upon in the direst of situations, what is left? Thought, after all, is the highest of human achievements, is it not? Perhaps not. Something supersedes thinking, despite its truly awesome power. When existence reveals itself as existentially intolerable, thinking collapses in on itself.

Later, however, in a more metaphorical frame of mind, I was struck quite deeply by the idea of a pen of light. There was something symbolic about it, something metaphysical. We re all in the dark, after all, much of the time. We could all use something written with light to guide us along our way.

When you decide to learn about your faults, so that they can be rectified, you open a line of communication with the source of all revelatory thought. Maybe that s the same thing as consulting your conscience. Maybe that s the same thing, in some manner, as a discussion with God. It was in that spirit, with some paper in front of me, that I asked my question: What shall I do with my newfound pen of light? I asked, as if I truly wanted the answer. I waited for a reply.

And that s why the King of the Damned is a poor judge of Being . How do you build yourself into someone on whom you can rely, in the best of times and the worst in peace and in war? How do you build for yourself the kind of character that will not ally itself, in its suffering and misery, with all who dwell in Hell? The questions and answers continued, all pertinent, in one way or another, to the rules I have outlined in this book: What shall I do to strengthen my spirit? Do not tell lies, or do what you despise. What shall I do to ennoble my body? Use it only in the service of my soul. What shall I do with the most difficult of questions? Consider them the gateway to the path of life. What shall I do with the poor man s plight? Strive through right example to lift his broken heart.",

Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either but right through every human heart and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains an unuprooted small corner of evil. Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety, but it is possible to constrict it within each person. Solzhenitsyn, A.I. (1975).

She has been an absolute pillar of honesty, stability, support, practical help, organization and patience during the years of writing that continued during anything and everything else that has happened in our lives, no matter how pressing or important. My daughter, Mikhaila, and my son, Julian, as well as my parents, Walter and Beverley, were also right there beside me, paying careful attention, discussing complicated issues with me, and aiding me in the organization of my thoughts, words and actions.

Dr. Norman Doidge went beyond the call of duty writing and revising the foreword to this book, which took far more effort than I had originally estimated, and the friendship and warmth he and his wife, Karen, continually provide has been very much appreciated by my entire family.

Gregg Hurwitz, novelist, screen-writer and friend, used many of my rules for life in his bestseller Orphan X , well before my book was written, which was a great compliment and indicator of their potential value and public appeal. Gregg also volunteered as a dedicated, thorough, viciously incisive and comically cynical editor and commentator while I was writing and editing. He helped me cut unnecessary verbiage (some of it at least) and stay on the narrative track. Gregg also recommended Ethan van Scriver, who provided the fine illustrations that begin each chapter, and I would like to acknowledge him for that, as well as tipping my hat to Ethan himself, whose drawings add a necessary touch of lightness, whimsy and warmth to what might otherwise have been a too-dark and dramatic tome.",

    "text": "FOREWORD fn1 Some argue mistakenly that Freud (often mentioned in these pages) contributed to our current longing for a culture, schools and institutions that are non-judgmental. It is true that he recommended that when psychoanalysts listen to their patients in therapy, they be tolerant, empathic, and not voice critical, moralistic judgments. But this was for the express purposes of helping patients feel comfortable in being totally honest, and not diminish their problems. This encouraged self-reflection, and allowed them to explore warded off feelings, wishes, even shameful anti-social urges. It also and this was the masterstroke allowed them to discover their own unconscious conscience (and its judgments), and their own harsh self-criticism of their lapses, and their own unconscious guilt which they had often hidden from themselves, but which often formed the basis of their low self-esteem, depression and anxiety.",

The Star of David (chaos order, feminine masculine) gives rise in the same way to the four basic elements: fire, air, water and earth (out of which everything else is built).

Orwell said, essentially, that socialists did not really like the poor. They merely hated the rich. 2 His idea struck home instantly. Socialist ideology served to mask resentment and hatred, bred by failure.

The great literary critic Northrop Frye comments upon the idea of the way, as it manifests itself in literature and religious writing: Following a narrative is closely connected with the central literary metaphor of the journey, where we have a person making the journey and the road, path, or direction taken, the simplest word for this being way. Journey is a word connected with jour and journee, and metaphorical journeys, deriving as they mostly do from slower methods of getting around, usually have at their core the conception of the days journey, the amount of space we can cover under the cycle of the sun.

The deity of chaos, or the unknown, appears most generally as feminine (and as half-negative, and half-positive) once the initial division between order and chaos has been established.

A mandrake root, for example, has the nature of a man, symbolically speaking, because it has the shape of a man; Mars is a warlike planet because it is red, and red, the color of blood, is associated indelibly with aggression; the metal mercury (and the spirit that inhabits it) is akin to seawater because both may serve as solvents or agents of transformation; the dark and the animal of the forest are the same, because they are both unfamiliar because they both inhibit ongoing behavior, when they make their appearance; because they both cause fear.",

All this appears very clearly from the Vedic ritual for taking possession of a territory; possession becomes legally valid through the erection of a fire altar consecrated to Agni. One says that one is installed when one has built a fire altar (garhapatya) and all those who build the fire altar are legally established. ( Shatapatha Brahmana, VII, 1,1,1 4).

There is a frightening likeness to Hathor, the good cow goddess, who in the form of a hippopotamus is the goddess of the underworld. She has a positive aspect, and at the same time she is the goddess of war and death.

The feminine, animal-mother character of this many- breasted creature is evident as is that of the monster wielding the terrible knife, which guards one of the underworld gates through which the souls of the departed must pass.

Elijah was not a priest. He had no formal authority for the terrible judgment he delivered. The normal pattern of the day would have called for him to be struck down by bodyguards on the spot. But the fact that he was speaking for an authority not his own was so transparent that the king accepted Elijah s pronouncement as just. The same striking sequence recurred in the incident of David and Bathsheba. From the top of his roof David glimpsed Bathsheba bathing and wanted her. There was an obstacle, however: she was married. To the royalty of those days this was a small matter; David simply moved to get rid of her husband. Uriah was ordered to the front lines, carrying instructions that he be placed in the thick of the fighting and support withdrawn so he would be killed.",

Subjugation to lawful authority might more reasonably be considered in light of the metaphor of the apprenticeship.

The leviathan is revealed to Job as the ultimate mystery of God s ways, the king over all the children of pride (Job 41:34), of whom Satan himself is merely an instrument.

All of my lofty disdain for the common man, who, so I thought, was guilty of the sin of unconsciousness, was, I now realize, founded on nothing more than jealousy and spite. I hated, I absolutely loathed anyone who had wrestled with their fear of leaving the maternal confines of a childish mentality and won their battle, only because I had not done so. I equated independence and success with egotism and selfishness, and it was my fondest hope, my highest ambition, to witness and participate in the destruction of everything that successful, independent people had built for themselves. This I considered a duty. In fact there was a decidedly fanatical element in my urge to cleanse the world of what I perceived to be selfishness. Maps of meaning 340",

Their mouths were stuffed with something soft and their arms were bound with cords behind their backs. Then they were led out into the courtyard, where harnessed carts were waiting. The bound prisoners were piled on the carts, from five to seven at a time, and driven off to the Gorka the camp cemetery. On arrival they were tipped into big pits that had already been prepared and buried alive . Not out of brutality, no.",

He is followed by his grisly assistants, his slaves, his holy guard. He sees the crowd gathered, stops, and watches from a distance. He sees everything: the placing of the coffin at His feet and the girl rising from it. His face darkens. He knits his thick white brows; his eyes flash with an ominous fire.

Piaget s value system considers rule by cooperation a more satisfactory equilibration in human relations than rule by authority. In order for a rule to work without authority pressures, there must be feelings of mutual respect among the persons who subscribe to the rule.568 This necessarily brings affectivity into considerations of morality.

Johannes Kepler, one of the fathers of modern or classical physics, said that naturally space must have three dimensions because of the Trinity! So our readiness to believe that space has three dimensions is a more recent offspring of the Christian trinitarian idea.

One of the chief fathers of natural sciences and a great protagonist of the absoluteness of the idea of causality was the French philosopher Descartes, and he based his belief on the immutability of God. The doctrine of this immutability of God is one of the Christian tenets: the Divinity is unchanging, there must be no internal contradictions in God, or new ideas or conceptions.

The alchemist was therefore compelled to formulate his quasichemical facts metaphysically too.606 The lack of scientific methodology the inability to conduct formalized comparison of behavior-predicated experience, to determine its generalizability meant the inextricable admixture of the purely sensory and the subjective, affective, mythological aspects of experience.",

The discovery of gravity, the force which keeps the planets in their orbits, did not completely satisfy him.

In modern days it could be more fully recovered from experience. 611 For this reason, Newton examined the most esoteric sections of the alchemical literature, hoping that they would contain the true secrets.

The incorporation of all competing states of motivation into a single hierarchy of value presupposes recognition of all diverse (painful, uncomfortable, difficult to manage) desires, and the forging of an agreement between them. This can be most accurately viewed as a potentially redemptive expansion of self-consciousness.

But that course in itself is not logical, far from it, and it seems likely that it depends on processes that we do not understand. The most powerful arguments for the non-existence of God (at least a good God) are predicated on the idea that such a Being would not allow for the existence of evil in its classical natural (diseases, disasters) or moral (wars, pogroms) forms.

First, it seems reasonable to insist upon the value of the natural moral distinction. The tragic circumstances of life should not be placed in the same category as willfully undertaken harm.

The paradisal initial condition, disrupted by the events of the Fall, also serves as the goal toward which history proceeds.

In the midst of paradise there rose a shining fountain, from which four streams flowed, watering the whole world. Over the fountain stood a great tree with many branches and twigs, but it looked like an old tree, for it had no bark and no leaves.

(Revelations 3:15 19) The idea of the Savior necessarily implies the Judge and a judge of the most implacable sort because the Savior is a mythological representation of that which is ideal, and the ideal always stands in judgment over the actual. The archetypal image of the Savior, who represents perfection or completion, is therefore terrifying in precise proportion to personal distance from the ideal. 6. Joyce, J. (1986), p. 28. 7.

This means that determinate experience must be considered an emergent property of behavior to a degree that is presently unspecifiable. This appears as true for the purely objective aspects of experience (which constitute the subject matter for science) (see Kuhn, T. [1970]; Feyeraband, P.K. [1981]) as for the subjective. The word itself, as case in point, can no longer reasonably be regarded as a label for a thing (Wittgenstein, L. [1968], pp. 46e 47e). The notion that a concept is a label for an object is nothing but a slightly higher-order version of the same error.

[1968], p. 150e). Wittgenstein was driving at a general principle: an object is defined, even perceived (categorized as a unity, rather than a multiplicity), with regard to its utility as a means to a given end. In a basic sense, an object is a tool or an obstacle. What we perceive as objects are phenomena that may be easily utilized (to grant our desires) at least in principle (or things that may well interfere with our attainment of desired ends).

This complex situation is further complicated by the fact that the valence o f objects, once given as objects, may still change with alteration in the ends we are pursuing (because tools in one situation may easily become obstacles or something irrelevant in another).

These include dreams, in which characters appear within experience in known and unknown guise, and follow what are apparently their own intrinsic and often incomprehensible laws of behavior (see Jung, C.G. [1968b] for an analysis of an extensive series of dreams [the physicist Wolfgang Pauli s, as it happens]).

This list of first rank schizophrenic symptoms is uniquely fascinating in the present context, for, as Nasrallah astutely phrases it, they can all be summarized by the basic idea that in the schizophrenic brain the unintegrated right-hemisphere consciousness may become an alien intruder on the verbally expressive left hemisphere. In other words, they are prototypical of what one might expect were interhemispheric communication so distorted that the left hemisphere could no longer identify the origin of activities in the right hemisphere as belonging to the unified consciousness of self.

In later literature the theme is carried much farther back: if we look at the fifth book of Paradise Lost, for instance, we see an archetype of the jealousy of an older son, Lucifer or Satan, at the preference shown to the younger Christ.

This theme has been revisited, in recent years, by Woody Allen, a great admirer of Russian literature, in his motion picture Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989).

Allen s protagonist, a respected physician, murders his mistress to prevent her from disrupting his family s (false) security. Unlike Raskolnikov, however, the good physician suffers no long-term psychic trauma, and everything returns to normal within the year. The movie, placid on the surface, is more horrifying than Dostoyevsky s tortured book. In the latter, moral order (predicated on respect for the intrinsic value of the individual) rules, in contrast to presumptuous rationality. In the former, rational meaninglessness prevails absolutely although it remains thinly veile d by urban pleasantry and pretence. 373. Nietzsche, F. (1968a), p. 217. 374. Tablet 6:152 153; Heidel, A.

This imaginative cosmos is neither the objective environment studied by natural science nor a subjective inner space to be studied by psychology. It is an intermediate world in which the images of higher and lower, the categories of beauty and ugliness, the feelings of love and hatred, the associations of sense experience, can be expressed only by metaphor and yet cannot be dismissed or reduced to projections of something else. Ordinary consciousness is so possessed by the either-or contrast of subject and object that it finds difficulty in taking in the notion of an order of words that is neither subjective nor objective, though it interpenetrates with both.

George Puttenham, writing in the 1580s, pointed to the etymology of poet as maker, which implied for him an analogy between the poet s creative power and the creative power of God in making the world. He quotes Ovid s phrase in the Fasti, est deus in nobis, which would mean either God or a god.

In a godly sense it is true, eternally, Christianly, as St. Paul says, that only one attains the goal which is not meant in a comparative sense, for comparison takes others into account.",

In a godly sense it is true, eternally, Christianly, as St. Paul says, that only one attains the goal which is not meant in a comparative sense, for comparison takes others into account.

And again this means that every man should be chary about having to do with the others, and essentially should talk only with God and with himself for only one attains the goal. And again this means that man, or to be a man, is akin to deity. In a worldly and temporal sense, it will be said by the man of bustle, sociability, and amicableness, How unreasonable that only one attains the goal; for it is far more likely that many, by the strength of united effort, should attain the goal; and when we are many success is more certain and it is easier for each man severally.

Thus, will is the true affective equivalent of the operation in reason. Will is a late-appearing function. The real exercise of will is linked to the function of the autonomous moral feelings, which is why we have waited until this [late-childhood] stage to discuss it. (Piaget, J. [1967], p. 58).

    "text": "Christ. On the branches, as the fruits of the tree, are the prophets and all Christ s ancestors. The roots of the tree grow out of the skull of Adam, and Christ is its central and more precious fruit. Jung amplifies this comment: Well, the tree sometimes grows out of Adam s navel, and on the branches, as you say, sit the prophets and kings of the Old Testament, Christ s ancestors, and then on top of the tree is the triumphant Christ. That life begins with Adam and ends with Christ is the same idea. (Jung, C.G. [1988], p. 1440). 663. Neumann states: Originally, Messianism was bound up with a historical process ending in the emergence of a savior who, after the transformation crisis of the apocalypse, ushers in the eschatological age of redemption. This conception can easily be shown to be a projection of an individuation process, the subject of which, however, is the people, the chosen collectivity, and not the individual.",

    "text": "al age of redemption. This conception can easily be shown to be a projection of an individuation process, the subject of which, however, is the people, the chosen collectivity, and not the individual. In the collective projection, history appears as the collective representation of destiny; the crisis is manifested in the projection of the ways which characterize the Last Days; and the transformation, as the Last Judgment, death and resurrection. Similarly, the transfiguration and conquest of the self corresponds to transfiguration in the celestial paradise which in the shape of a mandala gathers in mankind, or else it is projected as life in a re-created and renewed world governed by the king-Adam- anthropos -self at its center.
